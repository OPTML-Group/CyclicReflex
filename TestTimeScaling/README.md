# Test-time scaling method with CyclicReflex

## How to navigate this project ðŸ§­

This project is simple by design and mostly consists of:

* [`scripts`](./scripts/) to scale test-time compute for open models. 
* [`recipes`](./recipes/) to apply different search algorithms at test-time. Three algorithms are currently supported: Best-of-N, beam search, and Diverse Verifier Tree Search (DVTS). Each recipe takes the form of a YAML file which contains all the parameters associated with a single inference run. 


## Getting Started

1. To run the code in this project, first, create a Python virtual environment using e.g. Conda:

      ```shell
      conda create -n sal python=3.11 && conda activate sal

      pip install -e '.[dev]'
      ```

2. Next, log into your Hugging Face account as follows:

      ```shell
      huggingface-cli login
      ```

3. Finally, install Git LFS so that you can push models to the Hugging Face Hub:

      ```shell
      sudo apt-get install git-lfs
      ```

4. You can now check out the `scripts` and `recipes` directories for instructions on how to scale test-time compute for open models!
